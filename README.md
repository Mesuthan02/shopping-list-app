# shopping-list-app
This report includes the overall structure, operation, and code explanation of the shopping list management application I have developed. The application allows users to create shopping lists, add products, and manage these lists. Additionally, it offers features for sharing and analyzing different lists among users.
General Structure of the Code
The code consists of two main classes: ShoppingList and FamilyMembers. These classes manage the shopping lists and user accounts.
ShoppingList Class
The ShoppingList class contains all the functions necessary for managing a user's shopping list. This class can perform operations such as adding and removing products, completing shopping, viewing previous shopping lists, and analyzing them.
Methods
•	__init__: Initialization method that keeps the current shopping list and records of previous shopping lists.
•	add_product: Adds a product to the shopping list.
•	remove_product: Removes a product from the shopping list.
•	complete_shopping: Completes the current shopping list and adds it to the previous lists.
•	view_previous_lists: Views previous shopping lists.
•	clear_previous_lists: Clears all previous shopping lists.
•	analyze: Analyzes previous shopping lists and determines the most frequently purchased product.
FamilyMembers Class
The FamilyMembers class manages different user accounts. This class performs operations such as adding users, viewing lists, deleting users, and listing existing users.
Methods
•	__init__: Initialization method that creates a dictionary holding user accounts.
•	add_member: Adds a new user.
•	view_members_list: Views all users' shopping lists.
•	delete_member_list: Deletes a user's list and account.
•	access: Authenticates a user and provides access to their shopping list.
•	view_existing_members: Lists existing users.
Main Menu Functions
These functions manage the user interface and allow users to select the operations they need.
•	main_menu: Displays the main menu options.
•	create_new_list: Creates a new user account.
•	access_existing_list: Provides access to an existing user account.
•	list_menu: Manages the shopping list menu and allows the user to perform operations on the list.
main Function
The main function contains the main loop of the program and allows users to select various operations from the main menu.
Operation of the Code
•	Initialization: When the program starts, the main function runs and displays the main menu.
•	User Operations: The user selects one of the operations from the main menu: creating a new user, accessing an existing user, viewing existing users, or deleting a user.
•	List Management: From the shopping list menu, the user can add or remove products, complete shopping, view previous lists, and analyze them.
Conclusion
This application allows users to easily manage their shopping lists and helps them save money by analyzing their shopping habits. The code structure is designed to be extensible and maintainable, making it easy to add new features in the future.
